<blockquote>
<p>There are numerous benefits to the eBook version of <em>Atomic Kotlin</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>You can always have it with you, on multiple devices: tablets, phones, and laptops/desktops.</li>
<li>Color syntax highlighting for code listings is available on color devices.</li>
<li>Many eBook reader applications provide dynamic searchability.</li>
<li>The eBook is less expensive than the print book.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your best eBook reading experience will be on a tablet computer. Tablets have been optimized for an excellent screen reading experience, and are now cheap enough that the cost of a tablet is often less than the cost of a print book. A tablet next to your laptop/desktop allows you to have the book open—without holding it open—next to the computer you’re working on, so you can easily solve the exercises without flipping screens back and forth.</p>
<p>eBook technology is still developing, so this atom contains recommendations for optimizing your eBook reading experience.</p>
<p>Note that most eBook readers allow you to make changes, including alternate font choices. In general, it’s best to leave the settings at their default. In particular, if you change away from the default font, you often lose the fixed-width font used for code listings.</p>
<h2 id="formats">Formats</h2>
<p>The <em>Atomic Kotlin</em> eBook is distributed in both EPUB (for all devices) and MOBI (for Amazon Kindle).</p>
<p>The eBook is not copy-protected so you can easily place it on all your devices. However the eBook <em>is</em> copyrighted and is intended for sale so please do not share it and ask your friends to buy their own copies.</p>
<h2 id="apple">Apple</h2>
<p>On iOS and OSX, iBooks provides an excellent reading experience and is the preferred EPUB reader for those platforms. Unfortunately, it has numerous problems:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It is not supported if your Mac is older and/or cannot run at least OSX Mavericks. In this case, you will need to use one of the alternative readers described later in this atom.</p></li>
<li><p>It is not supported on older iPads and iPhones. Alternatives are given later in this atom.</p></li>
<li><p>Apple has a storied history of breaking iBooks during upgrades. This happened on Bruce’s iPad—everything was working fine, and then an iOS upgrade made the books in iBooks unreadable. Apparently, a further upgrade to a newer iOS was supposed to fix the problem, but that iOS version was not supported on his iPad model.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, if you have Mac/iOS devices, it’s worth trying to load the EPUB file into iBooks, but it might not work because of broken Apple software. If this happens to you, your best alternative is to load it onto Google Play Books, which works well on all iOS devices and the Mac. For Macs, Readium also produces a nice reading experience.</p>
<h3 id="transferring-the-epub">Transferring the EPUB</h3>
<p>To transfer the EPUB file to your Apple devices, the easiest approach is to use iCloud. iCloud requires that your Mac be running at least OSX 10.7 Lion. It also works on Windows 7 or later.</p>
<p>If you cannot run iCloud, use Dropbox to transfer the file. This requires that you experiment to find the “open in” option in order to open the file in iBooks.</p>
<h2 id="windowslinux">Windows/Linux</h2>
<p>If you’re running Windows or Linux, or your Mac doesn’t support iBooks, there are a number of other EPUB readers to choose from.</p>
<h3 id="the-microsoft-edge-browser">The Microsoft Edge Browser</h3>
<p>If you are on Windows, the Edge browser might be your best desktop experience. It has native support for EPUB with built-in searchability.</p>
<h3 id="readium">Readium</h3>
<p>One of the best cross-platform readers we’ve found for Desktop &amp; Laptop reading is <a href="http://readium.org/">Readium</a>. It runs atop Chrome, but you don’t see any indication of that—it feels just like a regular desktop application. Readium works on all platforms: Windows, Mac, and Linux.</p>
<p>The only current drawback is searchability—for some reason there is no search feature. However, in this book the chapters (“atoms”) are so small that the table of contents is effectively the same as an index.</p>
<h3 id="google-play-books">Google Play Books</h3>
<p>Google Play Books works across all devices—desktops, tablets, and phones. It is a premium experience on tablets and phones. An eBook that you upload on your desktop is automatically available on all your other devices. Google Play Books keeps track of which page you’re on and allows you to synch between devices.</p>
<h3 id="calibre">Calibre</h3>
<p>Although <a href="https://calibre-eBook.com/">Calibre</a> is a complete set of tools for creating and modifying eBooks, it also comes with a good desktop EPUB reader. Calibre works on Windows, OSX, and Linux.</p>
<h3 id="kindle">Kindle</h3>
<p>Amazon’s Kindle Application works on most tablets, including iPads regardless of version. Amazon’s Kindle Fire tablet computer has become very cheap, and has native support for eBooks.</p>
<p>To place the MOBI version of the eBook on your Kindle, follow <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/sendtokindle/email">Amazon’s Instructions</a> for emailing the MOBI version of the book to your Kindle device, and it will automatically appear there.</p>
<h2 id="phones">Phones</h2>
<p>By keeping the code listings limited to a narrow width, <em>Atomic Kotlin</em> reads nicely on smart phones.</p>
<p>If you have an iPhone, iBooks is worth trying first, although as previously noted the iBooks application is unreliable across different Apple devices and versions of iOS.</p>
<p>Google Play Books works on most smartphones (including iPhones), and provides an excellent reading experience.</p>
<p>Amazon’s Kindle Application works on most smartphones, including iPhones.</p>
