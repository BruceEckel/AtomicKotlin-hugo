Each atom in *Atomic Kotlin* is accompanied by several exercises to cement your
understanding of the material. We recommend solving the exercises directly
after reading an atom. All exercises can be checked automatically within
IntelliJ IDEA, and you can see your progress while solving them.

To solve the exercises, install IntelliJ IDEA with the EduTools plugin by
following these tutorials:

1. [Install IntelliJ IDEA and the EduTools
Plugin](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/education/install-edutools-plugin.html).

2. [Open the Atomic Kotlin course and solve the
exercises](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10081-edutools/docs/learner-start-guide.html?section=Atomic%20Kotlin).

In the EduTools course, you'll find solutions for all exercises. If you're
stuck on a task, you can check the hints or peek at the solution---if you do
this, we still recommend implementing it yourself.

If you have any problems setting up and running the course, please read [The
Troubleshooting Guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/education/troubleshooting-guide.html).
If that doesn't solve your problem, please contact the support team as mentioned
in the guide.

If you find a mistake in the course content (for example, a test for a task
produces the wrong result), please use our issue tracker to report the problem
with [This Prefilled
Form](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/newIssue?project=EDC&summary=AtomicKotlin%3A%20%3C%3C%20atom%20%2B%20exercise%20%3E%3E&description=%3C%3C%20Describe%20the%20problem%20here%20%3E%3E&c=Subsystem%20Kotlin&c=Assignee%20svtk).

## Exercises and Solutions in Text Form

If for some reason you are unable to use the exercises and solutions in the
EduTools format, they are also available in plain text form
[here](https://github.com/svtk/AtomicKotlinCourse/releases/latest), along with
