# AtomicKotlin-hugo

Hugo Static Site sources for the book website

Because of the theme, the site automatically works well on phones as well as
computers and tablets.

Everything is in markdown so it's very easy to add/edit content. If you look
at the "content" subdirectory you'll see how straightforward it is to add new
pages.
